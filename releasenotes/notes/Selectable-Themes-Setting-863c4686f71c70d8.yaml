    AVAILABLE_THEMES was used to determine whether a
    theme was selectable via the user facing widget,
    however it was noted that sometimes a parent theme
    is desired for inheritance, and needs to be hidden
    from the widget entirely.  SELECTABLE_THEMES was
    added as a setting that can be used to collect
    a theme for inheritance, but hide it from the
    user's view.  See the settings documentation for
    usage specifics.
